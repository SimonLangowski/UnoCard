<h1>Uno Card Instructions</h1>
<h2>Starting the game</h2>
<p>Each player starts with 7 cards.  The player who made the lobby goes first, and players play in sequential order.<p>
<h2>On Your Turn</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may play a card from your hand if it matches the color or number of the card played by the last player</li>
<li>You may draw a card from the deck if you cannot play (or if you just want to)</li>
<li>See the card descriptions for special effects they may affect what you can play on your turn</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winning and Losing the Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>You win the game by playing all of your cards</li>
<li>If you have more than 16 cards at any time, you are knocked out</li>
<li>When someone wins, the remaining players are ranked by their number of cards</li>
<li>Ties are broken by turn order</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Attack Count</h2>
<p>Whenever a draw 2, draw 3, or draw 5 card is played, the attack count is increased.  The next player can either draw the number of cards in the attack count or play an attack card of greater value (Specifically, draw 2 cannot be played on draw 3, and nothing can be played on draw 5).  Drawing resets the attack count to 0.   The Shield card can be used to block any attack.<p>

UnoCard is a online multiplayer server to play a modified version of Uno made for the CS252 final project collaboratively with Herrick Yeh. Features include lobbies, accounts, and real time gameplay. Serverside is written in javascript using node.js, while the front end uses angular to update elements and websockets to coordinate moves.
